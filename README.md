## 🌍 Overview

`jexactyl-monaco` is a free-to-use addon for **Jexactyl** that allows you to **edit server files** directly from the panel using the **Monaco Editor** (the same editor used in VSCode).  
This makes file management faster, easier, and more intuitive without the need for external software.

👉 Revised and expanded version of [Code Editor for Pterodactyl](https://www.sourcexchange.net/products/code-editor-for-pterodactyl).
👉 Inspired by modern code editors for seamless integration into Jexactyl.
